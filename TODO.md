#Things to do
It works fine for now but the following would be nice:
* Support ETH contract and tokens
* Do a bulk call to CoinGecko instead of calling a token at a time.
* Create a logo
* Get rid of react create crap
* Build some tests
* Extract {ethereum} in MetaMaskControl and rename
* Pretty up the CSS
