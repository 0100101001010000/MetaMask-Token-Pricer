Don't know where to start, check out the TODO list

Here are a few guidelines to follow to keep everyone happy.

##Getting started

1. Raise a new issue to start the discussion on the change that you would like to make.
2. Fork the code and make your changes. Make sure you run the tests (hopefully they'll exist by then...).
3. Raise a PR and check the code into a new branch. It'll be reviewed and if all goes well be a part of the codebase.

##How to report a bug

If you find a bug raise an issue and I'll eventually fix it.

##Suggestions/Improvements

If you think of something that could improve this raise an issue, and we will discuss it.
